### This section of the repo will undergo a MASSIVE reconstruction

Our goal is to create a file structue similar to this...a replica of how we want ArcGIS Pro to eventually store our data.
```
> FEMA Shapefiles
  > 2000-2009
      > Biological Disasters
          > Reservation Data
              > res.csv
          > County Data
              > county.csv
      > Chemical Disasters
      > Etc.

  > 2010-2019
      > Biological Disasters
          > Reservation Data
              > res.csv
          > County Data
              > county.csv
      > Chemical Disasters
      > Etc.

  > 2020+
      > Biological Disasters
          > Reservation Data
              > res.csv
          > County Data
              > county.csv
      > Chemical Disasters
      > Etc.
```

for the meantime, pull files from this section if you please. But, note that files ***will*** be removed, alterned, and modified heavily.

(See front page of DRASTIC repository for updates of this page...)
